<body>
    <p>I have enjoyed photography throughout the years.  Anything from wildlife, architecture, or motorsports.  I feel I got my love of photography from both of my Grandpas. 
        One of my Grandpas was known for having a darkroom and developing his own picture while the other was always seen with a camera in his hand. 
        I have several of his cameras now from 2 Kodak "brownies" to his Polaroid OneStep Instant camera. </p>
